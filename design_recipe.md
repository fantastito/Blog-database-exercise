# Two Tables Design Recipe Template

_Copy this recipe template to design and create two related database tables from a specification._

## 1. Extract nouns from the user stories or specification

```
As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a title.

As a blogger
So I can write interesting stuff
I want to write posts having a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want to allow comments on my posts.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the comments to have a content.

As a blogger
So I can let people comment on interesting stuff
I want the author to include their name in comments.
```
```
Nouns:

post, title, post content, post comments, comments content, comment author name
```

## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns

Put the different nouns in this table. Replace the example with your own nouns.

| Record                | Properties          |
| --------------------- | ------------------  |
| post                  | title, content, 
| comment               | content, author name, post id

1. Name of the first table (always plural): `posts` 

    Column names: `title`, `content`

2. Name of the second table (always plural): `comments` 

    Column names: `content`, `author_name`, `post_id`

## 3. Decide the column types

```

Table: posts
id: SERIAL
title: text
content: text

Table: comments
id: SERIAL
author_name: text
content: text
post_id: int
```

## 4. Decide on The Tables Relationship

Most of the time, you'll be using a **one-to-many** relationship, and will need a **foreign key** on one of the two tables.

To decide on which one, answer these two questions:

1. Can one POST have many COMMENTS? (Yes/)
2. Can one COMMENT have many POST? (/No)

You'll then be able to say that:

1. **[A] has many [B]**
2. And on the other side, **[B] belongs to [A]**
3. In that case, the foreign key is in the table [B]

*If you can answer YES to the two questions, you'll probably have to implement a Many-to-Many relationship, which is more complex and needs a third table (called a join table).*

## 5. Write the SQL

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- file: posts_table.sql

-- Replace the table name, columm names and types.

-- Create the table without the foreign key first.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text,
  content text
);

-- Then the table with the foreign key second.
CREATE TABLE comments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  author_name text,
  content text,
-- The foreign key name is always {other_table_singular}_id
  post_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(post_id)
    references posts(id)
    on delete cascade
);

```

## 6. Create the tables

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 blog < blogs_table.sql
```
```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < albums_table.sql
```
